I am a quantum scientist at Amazon Braket, leading the quantum compilation efforts. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D degree from [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) and my advisor was [Frederic T. Chong](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/). Before that, I got my bachelor degree from [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). During my Ph.D, I also stayed at IBM for 1 year as the [NSF QISE-NET fellow](https://qisenet.uchicago.edu/), working with [Andrew
Cross](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yK_ZfbwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ali
Javadi-Abhari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-I6kav0AAAAJ&hl=en), and spent a summer at [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/) as the [W.J.Cody fellow](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/wj-cody-associates), working with [Paul Hovland](https://www.anl.gov/profile/paul-hovland). I contributed to several quantum compilers, including [Giallar](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3519939.3523431), [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra) and [ScaffCC](https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC).

My research interests lie in quantum compilation, quantum architecture design and formal verification. The main theme of my research is breaking abstraction layers in the current quantum computing stack and re-establishing new abstraction layers, examples including breaking the quantum gate abstraction by pulse-level compilation, and breaking the qubit abstraction by using bosonic qubit encodings. For a summary, see our [PIEEE review article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielaam/5/9143211/9116963-aam.pdf) with collaborators from UChicago, Princeton, Duke, IBM, AWS and Caltech.
