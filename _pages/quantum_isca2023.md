title: ISCA 2023 A  Crash Course on Quantum Computing
nav: true
nav_order: 1
---
Discover the fascinating world of quantum computing tailored for computer architects in our one-day crash course on June 18th, 2023 at [the ISCA conference](https://iscaconf.org/isca2023/). 
The goal of this crash course is to provide researchers in CS and ECE with the fundamental background 
on quantum computing and equip them with the skills to write code and optimize quantum programs
on real quantum computers. This tutorial assumes no prior knowledge about quantum computing and by
the end, we expect the attendees will be able to follow recent works quantum computing papers from
HPCA, MICRO, ISCA, ASPLOS and be in a position to kick-start quantum research independently.

The tutorial will be organized by [Poulami Das](https://sites.gatech.edu/poulamidas/), [Yunong Shi](yunongshi.me), and [Moinuddin Qureshi](https://moin.cc.gatech.edu/).  Poulami Das is a
Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Tech and her research interests are software and architecture for reliable quantum
computing.  Yunong Shi is a senior scientist at Amazon Braket, leading the quantum compiler science team.  Moinuddin Qureshi is a Professor of Computer Science at Georgia Tech.
