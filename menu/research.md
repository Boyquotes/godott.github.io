Quantum Compilation
-------------------
<p id="secondarytitle"> Breaking the ISA abstraction </p> 
We proposed a new quantum compilation scheme for near-term quantum architectures utilizing quantum optimal control algorithms. By breaking down intermediate-scale quantum circuits into small subcircuits with size quantum optimal control algorithms can scale up to, we generate optimized pulse sequences for each subcircuits. Using reinforcement learning techniques, we ensure the parallelism of the circuit is protected and commutative gates are scheduled in a way that maximize the speedup in each subcircuit. This compilation methodology essentially break the ISA abstraction of 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates. In this way, pulse time has shown to be improved by a considerable amount in most cases.
