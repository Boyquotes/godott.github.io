Quantum Compilation
-------------------
We proposed a new quantum compilation scheme for near-term quantum architectures utilizing quantum optimal control algorithms. By breaking down intermediate-scale quantum circuits into small sub circuits, of which the size quantum optimal algorithms can scale up to, we generate optimized pulse sequences for each subcircuits. This compilation methodology essentially break the ISA of 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates. pulse time has shown to be proved by a considerable amount in most cases.
