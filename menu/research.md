Quantum Compilation
===================
We propose a new quantum compilation scheme for near-term quantum architectures utilizing quantum optimal control algorithms. By breaking down intermediate-scale quantum circuits into small sub circuits, of which the size quantum optimal algorithms can scale up to, we essentially break the ISA abstraction of 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates. However, efficiency has shown to be proved by a considerable amount.


Quantum error correction
========================
Various error correction codes has been
