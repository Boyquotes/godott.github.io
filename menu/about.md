I am a 6th year graduate student, in the department of Physics, at the University of Chicago. I am in the quantum architecture group, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/"> Fred Chong</a>. My interests lie in:
<ul>
  <li>Quantum compilation optimization for near-term quantum devices. </li>
  <li>Alternative qubit architectures. </li>
  <li>Program verification for quantum computing.  </li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
In the year 2018-2019, I spent one year at IBM Yorktown Heights as part of the <a href="https://qisenet.uchicago.edu">QISE-NET</a> triplet, working with Andrew W. Cross on quantum compilation, quantum verification in the Qiskit framework and on designing protocols for preparing bosonic qubit codes in the cavity.
</p>

<p>
I also contributed to <a href="https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC">ScaffCC</a>, a industrial level quantum compiler capable of compiling quantum circuits of millions of quantum gates. I designed and implemented the circuit optimization pass in ScaffCC and wrote the QAOA(Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) library. I am designing various new backends aimed at near-term quantum architectures.

In summer 2017, I was the <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/career-opportunities/wj-cody-associates">WJ Cody fellow</a> in Argonne National Laborotary, participating in PROVESA project, with Professor Paul Hovland. I used formal verification and model checking to faciliate the safe migration of large numerical softwares to new super computing architecture.
