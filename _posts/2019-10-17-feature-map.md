I just discovered two recent papers on doing machine learning in quantum space. This blog is basically my read on the simple but elegant idea presented in these two papers. In these two work, the authors essentially associated kernel space for ML tasks with quantum Hilbert space. This is an idea that is so straightforward that makes you wonder why it was not the first thought when people combines machine learning with quantum computing.
