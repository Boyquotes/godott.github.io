I am a 5th year graduate student, in the department of Physics, at the University of Chicago. I am in the quantum architecture group, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/"> Fred Chong</a>. My interests lie in:
<ul>
  <li>Quantum compilation optimization for NISQ(Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) technology, and in general. </li>
  <li>Program verification for quantum computing.  </li>
  <li> Quantum languages.</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>
I contributed to <a href="https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC">ScaffCC</a>, a industrial level quantum compiler capable of compiling quantum circuits of millions of quantum gates. I designed and implemented the circuit optimization pass in ScaffCC and wrote the QAOA(Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) library. I am designing various new backends aimed at near-term quantum architectures.

In summer 2017, I was the <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/career-opportunities/wj-cody-associates">WJ Cody fellow</a> in Argonne National Laborotary, participating in PROVESA project, with Professor Paul Hovland. I used formal verification and model checking to faciliate the safe migration of large numerical softwares to new super computing architecture.

In summer 2018, I will be at IBM as part of the <a href="https://qisenet.uchicago.edu">QISE-NET</a> triplet, working with Andrew W. Cross on quantum compilation.
